# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Jeffrey Fellows

Zinsserâ€™s main points introduced in _On Writing Well_ are that we typically write too much to sound important, and we often clutter our writing with unnecessary words. In an age where people are quickly distracted, it only adds to the problem by including information that could be more easily said with less. It is not the fault of the reader, but instead the writer for making sentences not understandable by readers who are new to the topic. The writer should keep things simple by avoiding clutter of needless words, and by simplifying sentences and phrases into basic content.
